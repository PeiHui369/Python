Subsetting columns
When working with data, you may not need all of the variables in your dataset. 
Square brackets ([]) can be used to select only the columns that matter to you in an order that makes sense to you. To select only "col_a" of the DataFrame df, use

//df["col_a"]
To select "col_a" and "col_b" of df, use

//df[["col_a", "col_b"]]
homelessness is available and pandas is loaded as pd.

# Select the individuals column
individuals = homelessness["individuals"]

# Print the head of the result
print(individuals.head())
