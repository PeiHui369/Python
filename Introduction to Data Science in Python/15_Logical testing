Logical testing
Let's practice writing logical statements and displaying the output.

Recall that we use the following operators:

== tests that two values are equal.
!= tests that two values are not equal.
> and < test that greater than or less than, respectively.
>= and <= test greater than or equal to or less than or equal to, respectively.

===
# Is height_inches greater than 70 inches?
print(height_inches > 70)

# Is plate1 equal to "FRQ123"?
print(plate1 == "FRQ123")

# Is fur_color not equal to "brown"?
print(fur_color != "brown")

<script.py> output:
    False
print(plate1 == "FRQ123")



<script.py> output:
    False
    True

<script.py> output:
    False
    True
    True
