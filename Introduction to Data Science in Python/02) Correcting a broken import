Correcting a broken import
In this exercise, we'll learn to import numpy, a module for performing mathematical operations on lists of data. 
The standard alias for numpy is np.

What did you need to change to make the import run without errors?

==========

# Fix the import of numpy to run without errors
// ori: import NumPy as np
import numpy as np

# Python is case-sensitive, so numpy must be all lowercase.
