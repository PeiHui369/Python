Inspecting a DataFrame
We've loaded the credit card records of our four suspects into a DataFrame called credit_records. 
Let's learn more about the structure of this DataFrame.

The pandas module has been imported under the alias pd. 
The DataFrame credit_records has already been imported.

How many rows are in credit_records?

===
# Use .info() to inspect the DataFrame credit_records
print(credit_records.info())



<script.py> output:
    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 104 entries, 0 to 103
    Data columns (total 5 columns):
     #   Column    Non-Null Count  Dtype  
    ---  ------    --------------  -----  
     0   suspect   104 non-null    object 
     1   location  104 non-null    object 
     2   date      104 non-null    object 
     3   item      104 non-null    object
