Correcting a function error
The code in the script editor should plot information from the DataFrame that we loaded in the previous exercise.

However, there is an error in function syntax. 
Remember that common function errors include:
- Forgetting closing parenthesis
- Forgetting commas between each argument
Note that all arguments to the functions are correct. 
The problem is in the function syntax.

===

# One or more of the following lines contains an error
# Correct it so that it runs without producing syntax errors

# Plot a graph
//ori: plt.plot(x_values y_values)
plt.plot(x_values, y_values)

# Display the graph
plt.show()
