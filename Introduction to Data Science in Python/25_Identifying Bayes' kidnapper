Identifying Bayes' kidnapper
We've narrowed the possible kidnappers down to two suspects:

Fred Frequentist (suspect1)
Gertrude Cox (suspect2)
The kidnapper left a long ransom note containing several unusual phrases. 
Help DataCamp by using a line plot to compare the frequency of letters in the ransom note to samples from the two main suspects.

Three DataFrames have been loaded:

ransom contains the letter frequencies for the ransom note.
suspect1 contains the letter frequencies for the sample from Fred Frequentist.
suspect2 contains the letter frequencies for the sample from Gertrude Cox.
Each DataFrame contain two columns letter and frequency.

# Plot each line
plt.plot(ransom.letter, ransom.frequency,
         label='Ransom', linestyle=':', color='gray')
plt.plot(suspect1.letter, suspect1.frequency, label='Fred Frequentist')
plt.plot(suspect2.letter, suspect2.frequency, label='Gertrude Cox')

# Add x- and y-labels
plt.xlabel("Letter")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")

# Add a legend
plt.legend()

# Display plot
plt.show()
