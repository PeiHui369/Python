Two methods for selecting columns
Once again, we've loaded the credit card records of our four suspects into a DataFrame called credit_records. 
Let's examine the items that they've purchased.

The pandas module has been imported under the alias pd. The DataFrame credit_records has already been imported.

===

# Select the column item from credit_records

# Use brackets and string notation
items = credit_records['item']
#or
# Use dot notation
items = credit_records.item

# Display the results
print(items)

<script.py> output:
