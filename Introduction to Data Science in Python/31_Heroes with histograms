Heroes with histograms
We've identified that the kidnapper is Fred Frequentist. Now we need to know where Fred is hiding Bayes.

A shoe print at the crime scene contains a specific type of gravel. 
Based on the distribution of gravel radii, we can determine where the kidnapper recently visited. 

The radii of individual gravel pieces has been loaded into the DataFrame gravel, and matplotlib has been loaded under the alias plt.

===

# Create a histogram
plt.hist(gravel.radius,
         bins=40,
         range=(2, 8),
         density=True) #Normalize your histogram so that the sum of the bins adds to 1.

# Label plot
plt.xlabel('Gravel Radius (mm)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Sample from Shoeprint')

# Display histogram
plt.show()
