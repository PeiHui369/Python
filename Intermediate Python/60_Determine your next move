Determine your next move
In the Empire State Building bet, your next move depends on the number of eyes you throw with the dice. 
We can perfectly code this with an if-elif-else construct!

The sample code assumes that you're currently at step 50. 
Can you fill in the missing pieces to finish the script? 
numpy is already imported as np and the seed has been set to 123, so you don't have to worry about that anymore.

===

# NumPy is imported, seed is set

# Starting step
step = 50

# Roll the dice
dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

# Finish the control construct
if dice <= 2 :
    step = step - 1
elif dice <=5 :
    step = step + 1
else :
    step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

# Print out dice and step
print(dice)
print(step)


<script.py> output:
    6
    53
