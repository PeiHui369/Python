Greater and less than
In the video, Hugo also talked about the less than and greater than signs, < and > in Python. 
You can combine them with an equals sign: <= and >=. 
Pay attention: <= is valid syntax, but =< is not.

All Python expressions in the following code chunk evaluate to True:
//
3 < 4
3 <= 4
"alpha" <= "beta"
//
Remember that for string comparison, Python determines the relationship based on alphabetical order.
