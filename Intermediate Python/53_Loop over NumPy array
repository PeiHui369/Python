Loop over NumPy array
If you're dealing with a 1D NumPy array, looping over all elements can be as simple as:

for x in my_array :
    ...
If you're dealing with a 2D NumPy array, it's more complicated.
A 2D array is built up of multiple 1D arrays. 
To explicitly iterate over all separate elements of a multi-dimensional array, you'll need this syntax:

for x in np.nditer(my_array) :
    ...
Two NumPy arrays that you might recognize from the intro course are available in your Python session: 
np_height, a NumPy array containing the heights of Major League Baseball players, 
and np_baseball, a 2D NumPy array that contains both the heights (first column) and weights (second column) of those players.

# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# For loop over np_height
for x in np_height:
    print(str(x) + " inches")

# For loop over np_baseball
for y in np.nditer(np_baseball):
    print(str(y))
    
    
    <script.py> output:
    74 inches
    74 inches
    72 inches
    72 inches
    73 inches
    ...
