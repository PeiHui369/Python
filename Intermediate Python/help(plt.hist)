help(plt.hist)
Help on function hist in module matplotlib.pyplot:

hist(x, bins=None, range=None, density=False, weights=None, cumulative=False, bottom=None, histtype='bar', align='mid', orientation='vertical', rwidth=None, log=False, color=None, label=None, stacked=False, *, data=None, **kwargs)
    Plot a histogram.
    
    Compute and draw the histogram of *x*.  The return value is a tuple
    (*n*, *bins*, *patches*) or ([*n0*, *n1*, ...], *bins*, [*patches0*,
    *patches1*, ...]) if the input contains multiple data.  See the
    documentation of the *weights* parameter to draw a histogram of
    already-binned data.
    
    Multiple data can be provided via *x* as a list of datasets
    of potentially different length ([*x0*, *x1*, ...]), or as
    a 2D ndarray in which each column is a dataset.  Note that
    the ndarray form is transposed relative to the list form.
    
    Masked arrays are not supported.
    
    The *bins*, *range*, *weights*, and *density* parameters behave as in
    `numpy.histogram`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (n,) array or sequence of (n,) arrays
        Input values, this takes either a single array or a sequence of
        arrays which are not required to be of the same length.
    
    bins : int or sequence or str, default: :rc:`hist.bins`
        If *bins* is an integer, it defines the number of equal-width bins
        in the range.
    
        If *bins* is a sequence, it defines the bin edges, including the
        left edge of the first bin and the right edge of the last bin;
        in this case, bins may be unequally spaced.  All but the last
        (righthand-most) bin is half-open.  In other words, if *bins* is::
    
            [1, 2, 3, 4]
    
        then the first bin is ``[1, 2)`` (including 1, but excluding 2) and
        the second ``[2, 3)``.  The last bin, however, is ``[3, 4]``, which
        *includes* 4.
    
        If *bins* is a string, it is one of the binning strategies
        supported by `numpy.histogram_bin_edges`: 'auto', 'fd', 'doane',
        'scott', 'stone', 'rice', 'sturges', or 'sqrt'.
    
    range : tuple or None, default: None
        The lower and upper range of the bins. Lower and upper outliers
        are ignored. If not provided, *range* is ``(x.min(), x.max())``.
        Range has no effect if *bins* is a sequence.
    
        If *bins* is a sequence or *range* is specified, autoscaling
        is based on the specified bin range instead of the
        range of x.
    
    density : bool, default: False
        If ``True``, draw and return a probability density: each bin
        will display the bin's raw count divided by the total number of
        counts *and the bin width*
        (``density = counts / (sum(counts) * np.diff(bins))``),
        so that the area under the histogram integrates to 1
        (``np.sum(density * np.diff(bins)) == 1``).
    
        If *stacked* is also ``True``, the sum of the histograms is
        normalized to 1.
    
    weights : (n,) array-like or None, default: None
        An array of weights, of the same shape as *x*.  Each value in
        *x* only contributes its associated weight towards the bin count
        (instead of 1).  If *density* is ``True``, the weights are
        normalized, so that the integral of the density over the range
        remains 1.
    
        This parameter can be used to draw a histogram of data that has
        already been binned, e.g. using `numpy.histogram` (by treating each
        bin as a single point with a weight equal to its count) ::
    
            counts, bins = np.histogram(data)
            plt.hist(bins[:-1], bins, weights=counts)
    
        (or you may alternatively use `~.bar()`).
    
    cumulative : bool or -1, default: False
        If ``True``, then a histogram is computed where each bin gives the
        counts in that bin plus all bins for smaller values. The last bin
        gives the total number of datapoints.
    
        If *density* is also ``True`` then the histogram is normalized such
        that the last bin equals 1.
    
        If *cumulative* is a number less than 0 (e.g., -1), the direction
        of accumulation is reversed.  In this case, if *density* is also
        ``True``, then the histogram is normalized such that the first bin
        equals 1.
    
    bottom : array-like, scalar, or None, default: None
        Location of the bottom of each bin, ie. bins are drawn from
        ``bottom`` to ``bottom + hist(x, bins)`` If a scalar, the bottom
        of each bin is shifted by the same amount. If an array, each bin
        is shifted independently and the length of bottom must match the
        number of bins. If None, defaults to 0.
    
    histtype : {'bar', 'barstacked', 'step', 'stepfilled'}, default: 'bar'
        The type of histogram to draw.
    
        - 'bar' is a traditional bar-type histogram.  If multiple data
          are given the bars are arranged side by side.
        - 'barstacked' is a bar-type histogram where multiple
          data are stacked on top of each other.
        - 'step' generates a lineplot that is by default unfilled.
        - 'stepfilled' generates a lineplot that is by default filled.
    
    align : {'left', 'mid', 'right'}, default: 'mid'
        The horizontal alignment of the histogram bars.
    
        - 'left': bars are centered on the left bin edges.
        - 'mid': bars are centered between the bin edges.
        - 'right': bars are centered on the right bin edges.
    
    orientation : {'vertical', 'horizontal'}, default: 'vertical'
        If 'horizontal', `~.Axes.barh` will be used for bar-type histograms
        and the *bottom* kwarg will be the left edges.
    
    rwidth : float or None, default: None
        The relative width of the bars as a fraction of the bin width.  If
        ``None``, automatically compute the width.
    
        Ignored if *histtype* is 'step' or 'stepfilled'.
    
    log : bool, default: False
        If ``True``, the histogram axis will be set to a log scale.
    
    color : color or array-like of colors or None, default: None
        Color or sequence of colors, one per dataset.  Default (``None``)
        uses the standard line color sequence.
    
    label : str or None, default: None
        String, or sequence of strings to match multiple datasets.  Bar
        charts yield multiple patches per dataset, but only the first gets
        the label, so that `~.Axes.legend` will work as expected.
    
    stacked : bool, default: False
        If ``True``, multiple data are stacked on top of each other If
        ``False`` multiple data are arranged side by side if histtype is
        'bar' or on top of each other if histtype is 'step'
    
    Returns
    -------
    n : array or list of arrays
        The values of the histogram bins. See *density* and *weights* for a
        description of the possible semantics.  If input *x* is an array,
        then this is an array of length *nbins*. If input is a sequence of
        arrays ``[data1, data2, ...]``, then this is a list of arrays with
        the values of the histograms for each of the arrays in the same
        order.  The dtype of the array *n* (or of its element arrays) will
        always be float even if no weighting or normalization is used.
    
    bins : array
        The edges of the bins. Length nbins + 1 (nbins left edges and right
        edge of last bin).  Always a single array even when multiple data
        sets are passed in.
    
    patches : `.BarContainer` or list of a single `.Polygon` or list of such objects
        Container of individual artists used to create the histogram
        or list of such containers if there are multiple input datasets.
    
    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    **kwargs
        `~matplotlib.patches.Patch` properties

    --------
    hist2d : 2D histograms
    
    Notes
    -----
    For large numbers of bins (>1000), 'step' and 'stepfilled' can be
    significantly faster than 'bar' and 'barstacked'.
    
    .. note::
        In addition to the above described arguments, this function can take
        a *data* keyword argument. If such a *data* argument is given,
        the following arguments can also be string ``s``, which is
        interpreted as ``data[s]`` (unless this raises an exception):
        *x*, *weights*.
    
        Objects passed as **data** must support item access (``data[s]``) and
        membership test (``s in data``).
