Indexes and values (1)
Using a for loop to iterate over a list only gives you access to every list element in each run, one after the other. 
If you also want to access the index information, so where the list element you're iterating over is located, you can use enumerate().

As an example, have a look at how the for loop from the video was converted:

fam = [1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89]
for index, height in enumerate(fam) :
    print("person " + str(index) + ": " + str(height))
    
    ===
    
    # areas list
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Change for loop to use enumerate() and update print()
for index, area in enumerate(areas):
    print("room " + str(index) +": "+str(area))
    
    >>
    <script.py> output:
    room 0: 11.25
    room 1: 18.0
    room 2: 20.0
    room 3: 10.75
    room 4: 9.5
