Add else
In the script, the if construct for room has been extended with an else statement so that 
"looking around elsewhere." is printed if the condition room == "kit" evaluates to False.

Can you do a similar thing to add more functionality to the if construct for area?

===

# Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if-else construct for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")
else :
    print("looking around elsewhere.")

# if-else construct for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
else :
    print("pretty small.")
    
    
    
<script.py> output:
    looking around in the kitchen.
    pretty small.
