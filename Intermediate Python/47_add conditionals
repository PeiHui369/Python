Add conditionals
The while loop that corrects the offset is a good start, but what if offset is negative? 
You can try to run the following code where offset is initialized to -6:

//
# Initialize offset
offset = -6

# Code the while loop
while offset != 0 :
    print("correcting...")
    offset = offset - 1
    print(offset)
//
but your session will be disconnected. The while loop will never stop running, because offset will be further decreased on every run. 
offset != 0 will never become False and the while loop continues forever.

Fix things by putting an if-else statement inside the while loop. If your code is still taking too long to run, you probably made a mistake!

while offset != 0 :
    print("correcting...")
    if offset > 0 :
      offset = offset - 1
    else : 
      offset = offset + 1    
    print(offset)
