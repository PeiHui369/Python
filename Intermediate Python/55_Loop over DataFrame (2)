Loop over DataFrame (2)
The row data that's generated by iterrows() on every run is a Pandas Series. This format is not very convenient to print out. Luckily, you can easily select variables from the Pandas Series using square brackets:

for lab, row in brics.iterrows() :
    print(row['country'])
    
    ===
    
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Adapt for loop
for lab, row in cars.iterrows() :
        print(lab + ": "+str(row["cars_per_cap"]))

<script.py> output:
    US: 809
    AUS: 731
    JPN: 588
    IN: 18
    RU: 200
    MOR: 70
    EG: 45
