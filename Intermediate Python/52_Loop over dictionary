Loop over dictionary
In Python 3, you need the items() method to loop over a dictionary:
//
world = { "afghanistan":30.55, 
          "albania":2.77,
          "algeria":39.21 }

for key, value in world.items() :
    print(key + " -- " + str(value))
//

Remember the europe dictionary that contained the names of some European countries as key and their capitals as corresponding value? 
Go ahead and write a loop to iterate over it!

# Definition of dictionary
europe = {'spain':'madrid', 'france':'paris', 'germany':'berlin',
          'norway':'oslo', 'italy':'rome', 'poland':'warsaw', 'austria':'vienna' }
          
# Iterate over europe
for k,v in europe.items():
    print("the capital of "+k+" is "+v)
    
    
   
    
<script.py> output:
    the capital of spain is madrid
    the capital of france is paris
    the capital of germany is berlin
    the capital of norway is oslo
    the capital of italy is rome
    the capital of poland is warsaw
    the capital of austria is vienna
