How many rows with a left join?
Select the true statement about left joins.

Try running the following code statements in the IPython shell.

left_table.merge(one_to_one, on='id', how='left').shape
left_table.merge(one_to_many, on='id', how='left').shape
Note that the left_table starts out with 4 rows.

---
In [1]:
left_table.merge(one_to_one, on='id', how='left').shape
Out[1]:
(4, 5)
In [2]:
left_table.merge(one_to_many, on='id', how='left').shape
Out[2]:
(232, 6)
===

The output of a one-to-many merge with a left join will have greater than or equal rows than the left table.

/*
A left join will return all of the rows from the left table. 
If those rows in the left table match multiple rows in the right table, then all of those rows will be returned. 
Therefore, the returned rows must be equal to if not greater than the left table. 
Knowing what to expect is useful in troubleshooting any suspicious merges.
