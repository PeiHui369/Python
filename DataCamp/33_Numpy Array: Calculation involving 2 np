Baseball player's BMI
The MLB also offers to let you analyze their weight data. 
Again, both are available as regular Python lists: height_in and weight_lb. height_in is in inches and weight_lb is in pounds.

It's now possible to calculate the BMI of each baseball player. 
Python code to convert height_in to a numpy array with the correct units is already available in the workspace. 
Follow the instructions step by step and finish the game!

---
Create a numpy array from the weight_lb list with the correct units. 
Multiply by 0.453592 to go from pounds to kilograms. 
Store the resulting numpy array as np_weight_kg.
Use np_height_m and np_weight_kg to calculate the BMI of each player. 
Use the following equation:
 
BMI = weight(kg) / height(m)^2

Save the resulting numpy array as bmi.
Print out bmi.

>>
# height_in and weight_lb are available as regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array from height_in with metric units: np_height_m
np_height_m = np.array(height_in) * 0.0254

# Create array from weight_lb with metric units: np_weight_kg
np_weight_lb = np.array(weight_lb)
np_weight_kg = np_weight_lb * 0.453592

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
bmi = np_weight_kg/(np_height_m ** 2) #No need to specify bmi is numpy array, as it deals with both numpy array, so it is

# Print out bmi
print(bmi)
