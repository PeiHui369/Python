Help!
Maybe you already know the name of a Python function, but you still have to figure out how to use it. 
Ironically, you have to ask for information about a function with another function: help(). In IPython specifically, you can also use ? before the function name.

To get help on the max() function, for example, you can use one of these calls:

@ help(max)
@ ?max

Use the IPython Shell to open up the documentation on pow(). Which of the following statements is true?

In [1]:
help(pow)
Help on built-in function pow in module builtins:

pow(base, exp, mod=None)
    Equivalent to base**exp with 2 arguments or base**exp % mod with 3 arguments
    
    Some types, such as ints, are able to use a more efficient algorithm when
    invoked using the three argument form.

pow() takes three arguments: base, exp, and mod. base and exp are required arguments, mod is an optional argument.
